## About

> Born in San Diego and raised in the Bay Area, I've always enjoyed learning about different cultures and gaining new perspectives.

This approach has helped me tremendously when it comes to my career in software development. I have spent time working with non-profits,
autonomous car companies, and teaching software development to the next generation. Whether the team was large, small, or I was working by myself,
one thing that remained constant was that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to your problem. Understand the technology you're working with,
consider your approaches, examine the trade-offs, and use your resources to make an educated decision.
